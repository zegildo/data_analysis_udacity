## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Diamonds}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x=price, y=x)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Calculating the correlation between price, x, y and z variables


```{r Correlation}
with(diamonds, cor.test(price,x))
with(diamonds, cor.test(price,y))
with(diamonds, cor.test(price,z))

```
## Simple Scatterplot between Price and Depth


```{r Simple Scatterplot}
qplot(data = diamonds,x = price,y = depth)

```



## Change Transparency


```{r Simple Transparency}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/100)
```

## Correlation

```{r Correlation between Depth and Price}
with(diamonds, cor.test(depth, price))
```

## Scatterplot

```{r Scatterplot between Price and Carat}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x=price, y=carat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlim(0, quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99)) + 
  ylim(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99))
```
## Scatterplot by Volune
Create a scatterplot of price vs. volume (x * y * z).
This is a very rough approximation for a diamond's volume.Create a new variable for volume in the diamonds data frame. This will be useful in a later exercise. Don't make any adjustments to the plot just yet. This assignment is not graded and will be marked as correct when you submit.

```{r Scatterplot between Price and Volume}
diamonds$volume <- diamonds$x * diamonds$y * diamonds$z
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x=price, y=volume)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Correlation Between Price and Volume

```{r Correlation between Price and Volume}
with(subset(diamonds, volume>0 & volume<=800), cor.test(price,volume))
```


## Adjustments Price and Volume
Subset the data to exclude diamonds with a volume greater than or equal to 800. Also, exclude diamonds with a volume of 0. Adjust the transparency of the points and add a linear model to the plot.
 
```{r Adjustments Price and Volume}
ggplot(data = subset(diamonds, volume>0 & volume <=800), aes(x=price, y=volume)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/100) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```


## Mean price by clarity
Use the function dplyr package to create a new data frame containing info on diamonds by clarity. Name the data frame diamondsByClarity The data frame should contain the following variables in this order.

       (1) mean_price
       (2) mean_price
       (3) min_price
       (4) max_price
       (5) n

where n is the number of diamonds in each level of clarity.
 
```{r  Mean price by clarity}
library(dplyr)
diamonds_group_by_clarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity) 

diamondsByClarity <-  summarise(diamonds_group_by_clarity,
                           mean_price = mean(price),
                           median_price = median(price),
                           min_price = min(price),
                           max_price = max(price),
                           n = n())

diamondsByClarity <- arrange(diamondsByClarity, clarity)
```

## BarChat of Mean Price
Weâ€™ve created summary data frames with the mean price by clarity and color. You can run the code in R to verify what data is in the variables diamonds_mp_by_clarity and diamonds_mp_by_color.

Your task is to write additional code to create two bar plots on one output image using the grid.arrange() function from the package gridExtra.
 
```{r  BarChat of Mean Price}
data(diamonds)
library(dplyr)

#install.packages('gridExtra')


diamonds_by_clarity <- group_by(diamonds, clarity)
diamonds_mp_by_clarity <- summarise(diamonds_by_clarity, mean_price = mean(price))

diamonds_by_color <- group_by(diamonds, color)
diamonds_mp_by_color <- summarise(diamonds_by_color, mean_price = mean(price))


library(ggplot2)

p1 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_mp_by_clarity, aes(x = clarity, y = mean_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

p2 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_mp_by_color, aes(x = color, y = mean_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 1)

```
